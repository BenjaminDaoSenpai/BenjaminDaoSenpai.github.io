        <h3>Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your story.</h3>
        <p>I learned how to handle the situation when a user enters an invalid input. For example, my story</br>
        prompted the user to enter "Y" or "N" to select a choice. In order to make sure the story progresses as</br>
        programmed, I had to program the function to inform the user that their input is invalid, and then allow </br>
        the user to enter a new input in order to prevent an infinite loop of error messages.
        </p>
        <h3>Think back to other stories you read, identify one or two stories you particularly like? Why?</h3>
        <p>I do not remember the name of the story, but it had to do with Attack on Titan. This story was </br>
        incapable of progressing after the program prompts the user to select a character, which I found amusing </br>
        as it reminded me of when I had an infinite loop issue with my error message, which took a while to figure out</br>
        how to fix. Aside from the Attack on Titan story, I feel that "Friendzone" was a terrific story as it reflected</br>
        elements from my story in there as well. The internal struggles the protagonist goes through while deciding who to be</br>
        their other really made it an enjoyable read.
